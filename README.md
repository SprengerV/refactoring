# refactoring
01 Git-HTML-CSS Homework

This project seeks to refactor code for a marketing agency's webpage with both accessability and search engine optimization in mind. This includes the use of semantic html tags to aid the use of screen readers and other assistive technologies. The refactoring was not limited to just the html file but also extended into the CSS stylesheet.
